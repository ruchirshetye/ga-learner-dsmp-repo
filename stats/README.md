### Project Overview

 **Superhero Statistics**

The rise of superheroes and supervillains is at an all time high. The 'Academy of Super Beings(ASB)' was formed to bring order to it. We have with us the data of more than 500 super humans but we need your knowledge of descriptive statistics in figuring out the important insights from it.

**About the Dataset**

The dataset has details of 594 super hero characters with the following 17 features.
Feature	         Description
ID	    				 Unique character ID</br>
Name	           Name of the character</br>
Gender	         Male/Female</br>
Intelligence	   Intelligence points of the character</br>
Strength	       Strength points of the character</br>

Total	           Total sum of all the above points of the character</br>
Height	         Height of the character(-99 value equates to 'immeasurable')</br>
