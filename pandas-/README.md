### Project Overview

 **Problem Statement :**
Dream Housing Finance Inc. specializes in home loans across different market segments - rural, urban and semi-urban. Thier loan eligibility process is based on customer details provided while filling an online application form. To create a targeted marketing campaign for different segments, they have asked for a comprehensive analysis of the data collected so far.

Our major work for this project involves data analysis using Pandas.

**Why solve this project ?**
After completing this project, I will have better grip on working with pandas. In this project I will apply following concepts.
* Dataframe slicing
* Dataframe aggregation
* Pivot table operations


### Learnings from the project

 - Loading the data in DataFrames
- Checking which variable is categorical and which one is numerical so that we will get a basic idea about the features of the bank dataset.
- Checking which columns have missing values and also check the count of missing values each column has. If we get the columns that have missing values, we will fill them.
- Using pandas methods such as pivot_table, .apply(), .groupby etc.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 This is the approach which I used to solve this problem.
- Using Pandas to load data into DataFrames
- Getting and idea of Categorical variables in the dataset.
- Filling missing Values of data with the Mode of the dataset.
- Getting insights from data by grouping data in a proper format.
- Peforming descriptive Statisitics on data.


### Challenges faced

 - Even though my logic was right, I wasn't coding the correct syntax of pandas. So I made a CheatSheet for myself and wrote down all the syntactical errors which I made.
